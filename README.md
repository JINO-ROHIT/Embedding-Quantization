# Binary and Scalar Quantization for Embeddings


This repository shows how to use binary and scalar quantization to reduce cost by 32x and improve latency by 32x along with retaining 97% of the original performance.


## Quick Start

To run the quantization pipeline:

    ```
    python caching.py
    ```
